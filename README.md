# Google-GenAI-Intensive-Course 🎓
# Resources, Notes, and Projects from Google's 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course 📚

This GitHub page gathers all the resources shared during the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive course. I came across this course randomly and found it comes with great resources.

Among these resources are whitepapers by Google experts, Kaggle LLM notebooks, and hours of YouTube live streams by the same Google team. Pretty cool stuff. 👍

I have compiled a list of resources by day and organized them by type (e.g., whitepapers, Kaggle notebooks, YouTube live streams).

**YouTube LiveStream:** ▶️ [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqFaTIg4myu-b1PlxitQdY0UYIbys-2es)
